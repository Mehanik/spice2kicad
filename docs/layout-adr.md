# Layout — Architectural Decision Record

Decisions made before implementation of the `spice-layout` crate.
Companion to `layout-roadmap.md` (the *what*) — this is the *how*
and the *why this and not that*.

Each decision lists the choice, the reasoning, and the
implications that downstream code must respect. Decisions are
numbered; later docs / commits can cite them as `ADR-3`, etc.

---

## ADR-1 — KiCad symbol library access

**Decision.** Parse the user's KiCad symbol libraries at runtime
(via `KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR` and the standard search paths). No
build-time bundling. No hand-written table.

**Why.** Most flexible, no vendoring drift, works with whatever
symbols the user actually has installed. The complexity is real
(parser for `.kicad_sym`, error handling for missing libs,
caching across runs) but it's a one-time investment.

**Implications.**

- A new module (or sibling crate) is needed to parse
  `.kicad_sym` files and extract pin geometry. Lives close to
  `kicad-emitter` since both speak KiCad s-expressions; consider
  factoring out `kicad-symbols` as a shared dep.
- Missing or unparseable libraries are CLI-time errors, not
  build errors. Diagnostics: a new `E0xx` code.
- Tests need a fixture library checked into `tests/fixtures/`
  to avoid depending on the developer's local KiCad install.
- Cache parsed libraries per CLI run; do not re-parse per
  symbol lookup.

---

## ADR-2 — Resolved-AST boundary

**Decision.** `spice-layout` consumes a `ResolvedNetlist`, not
the raw parser AST. Symbol lookup, `pinmap` application, and
pin-geometry attachment happen in a *resolution* pass that sits
between `spice-parser` and `spice-layout`.

**Why.** Makes `spice-layout` a pure function
`ResolvedNetlist → Placement`. Easier to test, easier to swap
algorithms, prevents symbol-lookup logic from bleeding across
crate boundaries.

**Implications.**

- A new resolution pass — likely in `spice-layout` itself or in
  a tiny `spice-resolve` crate — owns this transformation.
- `ResolvedNetlist` is a public type. Each resolved element
  carries: SPICE refdes, library-symbol id, pin geometry
  (positions relative to symbol origin in grid units), and the
  SPICE-terminal-to-KiCad-pin mapping.
- The placer never imports `spice-parser` types directly; the
  resolved type is the only dependency.

---

## ADR-3 — Orientation and mirroring in the search space

**Decision.** Per-element orientation (0/90/180/270) and mirror
state (mirror-x / mirror-y) are **part of the SA search**, not a
fixed pre-pass heuristic.

**Why.** Tight layouts and analog idioms (diff pairs needing
mirror symmetry, transistors flipped to put collector on the
power rail) are unrouteable without orientation freedom. A fixed
heuristic is a local optimum.

**Implications.**

- Each part has 8 possible orientation states (4 rotations × 2
  mirrors). The SA move set must include orientation/mirror
  flips alongside position moves.
- Cost in state-space size: 8× per part. Mitigations:
  (a) seed with a sensible orientation per element kind so SA
  rarely needs to flip; (b) make orientation moves rarer than
  position moves in the proposal distribution.
- Pin geometry must be queryable in any of the 8 orientations.
  The `kicad-symbols` module exposes a transform helper.
- Constraint lowering must be orientation-aware: `place=right-of`
  asks "which pin is *currently* the leftmost connecting pin?"
  — a function of the candidate orientation.

## ADR-4 — Non-determinism with sidecar position file

**Status: wired.** Implemented as `<basename>.layout.json` next to the
emitted `.kicad_sch`. The schema and reader/writer live in
`crates/spice-layout/src/sidecar.rs` (`Sidecar`, `SidecarEntry`,
`sidecar_path_for`); the placer accepts the cache as a
`spice_layout::Hint` via `place_with_hint`, reusing the same
per-element `pinned` mask that `align` / `place` use (no parallel
path). The CLI (`crates/spice2kicad/src/main.rs`) reads the sidecar
before placement and rewrites it after, on every run; `--no-layout-cache`
opts out. The acceptance test is
`crates/spice2kicad/tests/layout_cache.rs` (add-one-element stability,
round-trip, removal-drops-from-cache, opt-out). The design below was
the intended plan and matches what shipped.

This sidecar is a **position-cache artifact** for re-layout
stability — *not* a configuration or annotation carrier. It does
not describe user intent; the converter owns its contents and
rewrites it on every run. It is therefore distinct from the
YAML/TOML/JSON config sidecar that CLAUDE.md forbids: that rule
bans encoding *annotations* outside the SPICE file, whereas this
is derived geometry the tool caches for itself.

**Decision.** SA is non-deterministic (RNG seeded from system
entropy). To support incremental updates and preserve user edits,
the converter writes a **sidecar artifact** alongside the
`.kicad_sch`: `<basename>.layout.json`, containing a stable mapping
from SPICE-refdes → `(grid x, grid y, rotation, mirror)`. (JSON via
`serde` was chosen for the format; see "What we are not deciding
now".)

On re-conversion:

1. If the sidecar exists, load it as a *seed*. Existing
   refdeses get pinned to their saved positions. SA only places
   new refdeses and resolves overlaps.
2. Removed refdeses are dropped from the sidecar.
3. The sidecar is rewritten on every run.

**Why.** Position stability under netlist edits is a hard
usability requirement — users will hand-tune the schematic in
KiCad, then re-import an updated netlist, and expect untouched
parts to stay put. A sidecar is simpler than reverse-parsing
positions out of the user's edited `.kicad_sch` (which would
require diffing against our last emission and is fragile).

**Implications.**

- Sidecar schema is a public artifact — versioned, documented,
  diffable in git. Probably JSON or TOML for human-readability.
  Decide format in implementation; not load-bearing now.
- The placer's contract becomes: "given a possibly-empty
  `Hint` of pinned positions, produce a placement that respects
  the hints unless they conflict with hard constraints".
- Hand-edited positions in the sidecar are user-overridable
  pins — same constraint mechanism the resolver already needs
  for `align`/`place`. Reuse the pipeline.
- Long-term: the sidecar can also store user-overridden
  orientations, decisions about which pattern detector fired,
  etc. Don't design that now; just leave room.
- The architecture had to accommodate this from the start because
  retrofitting position stability is a refactor — which is why it
  was designed before it was wired (now shipped; see the Status note
  above).

---

## ADR-5 — Pre-flight conflict check

**Decision.** Before running optimization, the resolver runs a
**policy / consistency pass** that detects unresolvable
constraint conflicts (jointly unsatisfiable `align` + `place`
combinations, cycles in relative-placement, cross-sheet refs,
etc.) and exits with an error. Optimization is only run when the
constraint system is known to be satisfiable.

**Why.** A best-effort SA on inconsistent constraints produces
a layout that violates user intent silently — exactly what spec
principle 8 ("hard errors on typos, soft warnings on conflicts")
warns against. Detecting it deterministically up front is
strictly better.

**Implications.**

- Conflict detection is its own module with its own test
  surface. Tests are property-based: generate constraint sets,
  check that satisfiable ones pass and unsatisfiable ones get
  diagnosed.
- New diagnostic code(s) for layout-policy errors. As built these
  landed in the `E0xx` range (`E006` directional `place` cycle,
  `E007` layout-unresolved) rather than a separate `E1xx` range;
  they are documented in annotation-spec §7.
- The cost function still has soft `δ` for constraint
  violations as a defense-in-depth, but in practice that term
  should never fire — if it does, it's a bug in the policy
  check.

## ADR-6 — Diagnostics interface (neutral type, ariadne at CLI)

**Decision.** Library crates (`spice-parser`, `spice-layout`,
future `spice-route`) emit a neutral `Diagnostic` type. `ariadne`
is a CLI-only dependency that translates `Diagnostic` to a
rendered terminal report at the boundary.

**Sketch:**

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Severity { Error, Warning, Note }

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct FileId(pub u32);

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct Span {
    pub file: FileId,
    pub start: usize,   // byte offset
    pub end: usize,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Label {
    pub span: Span,
    pub message: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Diagnostic {
    pub code: &'static str,         // "E001", "W101", …
    pub severity: Severity,
    pub message: String,             // headline
    pub primary: Label,              // offending span
    pub secondary: Vec<Label>,       // "previously declared here", …
    pub help: Option<String>,
}
```

Lives in a small shared crate (`spice-diagnostics` or similar)
or as `spice_parser::diag` re-exported. Each library returns
`Result<Output, Vec<Diagnostic>>` for fatal cases and
`(Output, Vec<Diagnostic>)` for soft-warning paths. CLI has a
single `render::ariadne(&[Diagnostic], &SourceMap)` adapter.

**Why this codebase specifically.**

- `spice-parser` already uses `thiserror` enums with no
  `ariadne` dep — a neutral type is the natural extension, not
  a step backwards.
- The placer will produce *many* diagnostics per run; a
  `Vec<Diagnostic>` channel is needed regardless. Making it
  neutral costs nothing extra.
- Future consumers (LSP server, JSON output for CI, web
  playground) will want non-terminal renderings of the same
  data. Ariadne is a renderer, not a data model.
- Spec §7 codes (`E001`, `W101`, …) are already the stable
  diagnostic API; ariadne is just one view of them.

**Implications & risk.**

- `FileId` is introduced **now**, even though v0.1 has one
  file. Adding `.include` later requires multi-file spans;
  retrofitting `FileId` onto every `Span` after the fact is
  painful. Source files are owned by a `SourceMap` in the CLI.
- Existing `spice-parser` errors get migrated to the new type.
  Small breaking change to that crate's public API; absorb it
  before there are external users.

---

## ADR-7 — Test strategy: property tests over placements

**Decision.** Primary verification is property tests over the
public `Placement` data: no overlaps, all coordinates on grid,
all hard constraints satisfied within tolerance, crossings ≤
baseline (a regression bound, not an absolute), all pins
reachable by orthogonal wires. A handful of `examples/` get
golden *placement* snapshots (not golden `.kicad_sch`) for
regression.

> **Reconciliation (see CLAUDE.md "Constraints vs. costs" — source
> of truth).** "Hard constraints satisfied within tolerance" above
> describes the soft-cost framing (cost.rs `constraint_violation`,
> very high δ). That framing is acceptable only for *continuous*
> preferences; a categorical placement constraint must be a
> candidate-space filter (reject infeasible moves at the
> `propose_move` boundary), because a finite-weight soft term can
> still be undone by an SA move. The property test should therefore
> assert categorical constraints hold *exactly* (a filter never
> emits a violation), not merely "within tolerance".

**Why.** Golden `.kicad_sch` is brittle — every weight tweak
breaks it. Property tests track the things we actually care
about; snapshots catch unintended global regressions.

**Implications.**

- The placer's public API exposes `Placement` as inspectable
  data — a struct of `Vec<PlacedElement>`, not just an opaque
  handle that emits s-exprs.
- `kicad-emitter` consumes `Placement`. Emission is its own
  test surface (s-expr correctness), separate from placement
  correctness.
- Property tests use `proptest` or `quickcheck`. Pick one in
  implementation; not load-bearing now.
- Snapshot format is the same human-readable text the sidecar
  uses (ADR-4) — single representation reused.

## ADR-8 — Performance target: ngspice-tractable circuits

**Decision.** Layout must keep up with circuits that ngspice can
realistically transient-simulate on desktop hardware. Concretely
this is **a few hundred to ~1k placeable elements** in interactive
time (target: <10s end-to-end for ~500 elements on a modern
laptop). Pathological larger netlists are best-effort.

**Why.** The output is a schematic for a human to read; circuits
that don't simulate aren't worth drawing. Ties the bound to a
real-world constraint instead of an arbitrary number.

**Implications.**

- FR/KK seeding is fine at this scale (quadratic in nodes is
  ~10⁶ ops — sub-second).
- SA budget should be tunable; default cools fast enough to
  meet the target on typical inputs. Slow-cool flag for cases
  the user is willing to wait on.
- Hierarchy (`.subckt` / `.include`) keeps the per-cluster
  problem small even for big designs.
- Don't spend implementation effort on placement algorithms
  that only pay off above ~10k elements.

---

## ADR-9 — Routing crate

**Decision.** Orthogonal wire routing lives in a separate crate
`spice-route`, consuming `Placement` from `spice-layout` and
producing routed wires for `kicad-emitter` to render.

**Why.** Routing is a different cost surface and a different
algorithm class (rectilinear Steiner trees). Mixing it into
placement couples two unrelated tuning loops.

**Implications.**

- `kicad-emitter` depends on both `spice-layout` (positions) and
  `spice-route` (wires).
- `spice-route` is implemented: a rectilinear-Steiner router
  (Hwang-exact for N=3, RMST + Borah-Owens-Irwin Steinerization
  for 4 ≤ N ≤ 9, plain RMST for N ≥ 10). Defining the crate
  boundary up front kept the emitter API stable across this work.

---

## ADR-10 — Cluster boundaries as soft attractors

**Decision.** `.include` cluster boundaries are **soft
attractors**, not hard rectangles. Members feel a force pulling
them toward the cluster centroid (and a repulsive force keeping
non-members out), but wires cross the boundary freely and the
boundary box is drawn around whatever bounding region the members
happen to occupy after layout.

**Why.** Matches spec §3's "purely visual" framing of `.include`.
Hard rectangles overconstrain the placer in tight layouts and
produce ugly empty space. Soft attraction gives the visual
clustering effect without forcing geometry.

**Implications.**

- Cluster membership becomes a term in the cost function: an
  attractive force among same-cluster elements, mild repulsion
  between clusters. New `θ` weight in §5.
- Cluster bounding boxes are *computed* from final positions,
  not specified up front. Emitted as decorative rectangles
  with the cluster name as a label.
- `.subckt` is **not** a soft attractor — it's a hard
  hierarchical sheet boundary. Keep the two mechanisms
  distinct; do not unify.

---

## What we are not deciding now

- ~~Sidecar file format (JSON vs TOML vs custom). Pick during
  implementation.~~ **Decided: JSON via `serde`** (see ADR-4 status).
- Specific RNG (rand vs fastrand vs other). Pick during
  implementation.
- Property-test framework (proptest vs quickcheck). Pick during
  implementation.
- Exact SA cooling schedule and weight values. Tune empirically
  against `examples/`.
- Whether `kicad-symbols` is its own crate or a module inside
  `kicad-emitter`. Decide when extracting.
